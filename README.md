# Ruby Playground
This is just a space to test and explore different object oriented patterns in Ruby. Although Ruby is used, the principles are language agnostic, and are based in best design practices to create durable and scalable code.

Examples have been extracted from the book [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz](http://lmgtfy.com/)

As a side note, I also learned some neat stuff about bicycles!
